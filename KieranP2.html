<p>We will review burger joints within a 15 mile radius from the school to determine the best burger joint in our area. Throughout our careers at Greenwich High School, the standard option for food has been Rinaldis or Corbos. There is little variety, and it is largely due to seniors not exploring new options for food and spreading these different restaurants through word of mouth.  We feel that it is our duty to explore other options for food, which will reveal new choices to eat during lunch.</p>
